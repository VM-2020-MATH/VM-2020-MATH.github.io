<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>I am now an assistant professor at the Department of Faculty of Science (Applied Mathematics), 
Shahid Rajaee Teacher Training University. 
I am working in Applied Mathematics, which involves solving partial differential equations
(PDEs) via numerical methods (mesh-dependent and meshless approaches) and analyzing 
their errors. Also, I specifically am studying the mathematical models in oncology. 
Other research interests include machine learning algorithms for solving PDEs 
and approximation problems.</p>
